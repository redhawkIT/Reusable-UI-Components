Smart/Container Component Characteristics

- Describe how things work
- Provide no DOM markup or styles
- Provide application data, do data fetching
- Top level

Dumb/Presentational Component Characteristics

- Describe how things look
- Low Level
- Have no app dependencies
- Receive only props, providing data and callbacks
- Rarely have own state, when they do, itâ€™s just UI state

Stateless Functional Components (Dumb/Presentational)

- Destructure your props in ES6
- Should state their dependencies. PropType validation is great for this.
- Will soon offer improved performance, no state or lifecycle methods. React team working on.
- Testable:view only renders according to the props passed down

Reusable UI Components

- Dumb/Presentational components
- Often are stateless functional components
- Composing higher-order components
- Styling components based on state or props
- React.PropTypes.node, props.children
- Third-party UI components (Material-UI & React-Bootstrap)
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- Generic & Flexible  
- Building blocks

Example Ideas

- Compose multiple Material-UI components to create a new one
- Refactor a demo to create a reusable component
- Create two components with different uses out of several reusable ones  

Example Idea

Create a few small reusable components

&lt;SvgIcon/&gt;

&lt;Avatar/&gt;

&lt;List/&gt;

&lt;ListItem/&gt;

&lt;Checkbox/&gt;

Using these create a playlist, contacts list
